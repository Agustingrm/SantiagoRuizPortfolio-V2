# Santiago Ruiz Portfolio

This project was the first one I did as a freelancer for a client. The client is an industrial designer and wanted a portfolio of his work to show it to clients. 
The client had quite definite ideas about the design of the page, for which he also provided typographies (In this case they are not included since they are not free to use, but a similar one is included).

## Language and Technologies Employed

- The application was made through **React** with **Typescript**.
- The styling was applied through **SASS** and applied to each particular file.
- **React-slick** was used for the carousel effect inside the projects.
- For the content management by the client a CMS was configured in **Sanity**, which gives him the ability to add, remove or rearrange how the different projects are seen within the application.
